# Node Theory

Throughout my journey in software engineering, I realized that almost every concept in computer science â€” from algorithms to distributed systems â€” can be traced back to **nodes and their interactions**.

## Core Idea of Node Theory

- **Each node manages its own state** and has a data source, though it doesnâ€™t necessarily need complex computation.
- **Each node interacts with its surrounding environment** to obtain resources or information.
- **The resources or information a node acquires can change its internal state**, which in turn may influence its behavior.
- **A nodeâ€™s existence always impacts the group**, but the effect depends on whether the group requires its state or logic to influence the overall process.
- Through these local interactions and state updates, **complex system behaviors emerge**, whether in microservices, distributed clusters, or recursive algorithms.

ðŸ’¡ **Key Insight:** Node Theory allows us to see computing systems as autonomous entities interacting within a network, where influence flows through data and state, not just computation.

This framework **unifies algorithms, system design, and distributed architectures** under a single, predictable, and teachable mental model.

It helps understand:
- Why certain nodes matter
- How data flows
- How local state changes propagate to global system behavior
